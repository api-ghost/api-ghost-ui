### Project Overview

API Ghost is a tool that simplifies complex API integration testing and load testing through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
Without writing any code, users can visually connect APIs in sequence on a web interface or define test scenarios using a simple YAML file.
This repository provides the GUI component, enabling consistent testing from local development to production environments.
It also offers clear, visual reports of test results, significantly reducing the time required for testing by development and QA teams.
